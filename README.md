## Rails facebook-connect boilerplate

This is a Rails boilerplate integrating devise **and facebook connect** for Le Wagon students. You can visit it at https://lewagon-rails-fb-connect.herokuapp.com

To launch the app, just run: 

```bash
$ bundle install
$ figaro install
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:migrate
```

After creating your facebook development and productions apps, add your API keys in the `config/application.yml` file generated by figaro:

```ruby
development:
  FB_ID: "3************1"
  FB_SECRET: "4************e"
```

And then 

```bash
$ rails s
```
